# Disease-Detection-in-Fruits-using-Deep-Learning
# Business Objective:
Disease detection in fruits is very important as it helps the farmer in getting a good yield.
This project is focused on the early detection of diseases in fruits and hence increase the
options available to the farmer in taking precautions to protect his produce. Usage of
modern technology in agriculture is the main objectives of this project and the
implementation of Image Processing using Deep Learning helps in obtaining accurate
results or detection.

# Feature Extraction:
In feature extraction desired features such as color, texture, morphology, and structure are
extracted. Feature extraction is method for involving number of resources required to
describe a large set of data accurately. The technique of extracting the features is useful
when you have a large data set and need to reduce the number of resources without losing
any important or relevant information. Feature extraction helps to reduce the amount of
redundant data from the data set.

# Conclusion:
This project uses innovative methods to detect diseases in fruits and is also a prototype in
implementation of the usage of modern technology in agriculture, especially in cash
crops. This project also aims at the thorough implementation of Digital Image Processing
techniques. The disease is detected in a very cheap and fast way and measures to stop the
spread of disease can be taken.
By using this concept, the disease identification is done for all kinds of Fruits the user can
rectify the problem very easy and with less cost. Here we use the concept of Deep
learning, this gives the results with more accuracy, hence that helps to take the early
precautions.
